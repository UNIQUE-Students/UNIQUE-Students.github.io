**Abstract submission deadline:** April 14, 2024 <br> <br>

**Note:** Participation in the event and submission of abstracts are open to anyone interested in the field of Neuro-AI (UNIQUE member or not). <br>
The work you submit should be related to both neuroscience and AI, but it doesn't have to be in equal part. Pilot studies, first results and work in progress are welcome alongside more finalized studies, as both can lead to great discussions! <br>

**Prizes: 4 prizes will be awarded to the best posters! Our thanks to Millenium Québecor for making this possible.**  <br>
**The decisions regarding the selection of abstracts will be sent out at the beginning of the week of April 14th.** <br>
