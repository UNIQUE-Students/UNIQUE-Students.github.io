  bio: "I am a Neuroscience PhD student at McGill University's Integrated Program, collaborating with Prof. Sylvain Baillet and Prof. John Kalaska in advancing knowledge of non-motor functions of the motor cortex, an area of the brain classically known for its role in executive functions such as decision making. I have a strong interest in devising and implementing sophisticated techniques to measure complex patterns in ongoing human brain activity. I am very excited to be part of the UNIQUE community and looking forward to collaborating with other members of this community to improve our understanding of the brain and develop new tools to address important questions in neuroscience."
