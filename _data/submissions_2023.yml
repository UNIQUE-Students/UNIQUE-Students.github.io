#   abstract: "Fast Streamlines Search (FSS) is a novel method that can accurately and efficiently find all similar streamlines (k-nearest neighbors or radius search). This method can be used to cluster white matter bundles, trajectories, or connections estimated from diffusion MRI tractography. Compared to previous approximatives tractography search methods [O’Donnell 2007; Olivetti 2017; Garyfallidis 2018], FSS accurately computes the distance between every pair of streamlines streamline, within a given radius. To improve FSS computation speed, we implemented a k-d tree that internally uses the desired L2,1 distance. Furthermore, we generalized the Nanoflann k-d tree implementation [Blanco 2014] to any Lp,q Minkowski norm (1 ≤ p, q < ∞). When organizing the tree structure for proximity search, the proposed tree uses the absolute difference with a “scaling factor” to evaluate the boundary of each axis. This factor guarantees that there are no false dismissals (false negatives), based on “p”, “q” and the number of dimensions. When a sub-tree is located within that boundary it directly computes the exact distance, and returns similar streamlines accordingly. The open source implementation, named TractoSearch (https://github.com/StongeEtienne/tractosearch), could be further developed to incorporate advanced tractography segmentation or registration algorithms."
