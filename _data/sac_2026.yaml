  bio: "I am a PhD student working with Vincent Taschereau-Dumouchel on bridging the gap between quantitative and qualitative approaches in cognitive neuroscience and computational psychiatry. During my master's, I worked on mapping out subjective experience using a combination of psychometrics, NLP and generative AI, with a focus on accelerating mental health care research. I now aim to develop innovative applications of AI to the study of brains and consciousness. Being part of the UNIQUE SAC, as well as the broader neuroAI community, has been a huge source of inspiration and motivation, which is why I'm eager to continue on this path for a second year."

  bio: "I am a Master’s student in psychology (specialization in computational and cognitive neuroscience) at Université de Montréal. I am co-supervised by Dr. Ian Charest and Dr. Frédéric Gosselin, studying the mental geometry of the human mind between vision and mental imagery similarities. My main research ambition is to turn imagination and mental content into something you can see, using advanced neuroimaging and neuromodulation techniques such as geodesic transcranial electrical neuromodulation. Outside the lab, I enjoy literature, rock music and getting lost in new countries. "
