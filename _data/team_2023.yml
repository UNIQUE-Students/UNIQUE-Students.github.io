  bio: "Kira graduated with a combined honors degree in neurobiology and psychology in 2022 at the University of Victoria.\
    \ Here, she conducted a thesis studying conscious versus subliminal perception and contributed to several papers reviewing non-neuronal cells in brain disorders.\
    \ She is interested in consciousness, cognitive computational neuroscience, and neurophilosophy. \
    \ Thus, during her master's program under McGill's Integrated Program in Neuroscience,\
    \ Kira is collecting high-density EEG data from comatose patients in the intensive care unit.\
    \ Namely, she is studying how varying levels of general anesthesia can change functional connectivity \
    \ and investigating whether these changes can index patient diagnosis or prognosis. \
    \ Furthermore, in a secondary project, Kira will apply machine learning techniques to DTI and EEG data to help identify patients with cognitive-motor dissociation."
