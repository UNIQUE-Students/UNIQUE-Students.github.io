  bio: "I am a PhD student in computer science. I am generally interested in modeling neural networks for understanding the brain and improving artificial intelligence. Particularly, learning algorithms that form memory and skills are of my interest because it contributes understanding the uniqueness of my human self. These algorithms may inspire researchers to innovate AI models that outperform in a new way. I am now narrowing down research topics related to the integration of bottom-up and top-down signals in neocortical circuits and its relation to learning and memory."

  bio: "I am a master's student in neuroscience at McGill University and I study the brain networks of unresponsive patients in the intensive care unit diagnosed with a coma or disorder of consciousness. By studying how their brain's react to general anesthesia, my goal is to identify network properties which can help improve patient diagnoses and prognostication. In addition to my research with brain-injured patients, I am also interested in studying the sentience and intelligence of non-human animals, such as invertebrates."

  bio: "I first worked as an engineer in renewable energy industry for 10 years, before completing am MSc in Neuroscience at UdeM on human attention and cerebral synchrony. Passionate about pedagogy, I am now developing innovative pedagogies for higher education or associations to address the cognitive challenges of ecological and social transition. In parallel, I am a PhD student in Psychiatry at UdeM, exploring the social interaction component of human consciousness and neurodiversity in the Precision Psychiatry and Social Physiology Lab at CHU Sainte-Justine!"

  bio: "I am a graduate student at Mila and Université de Montréal supervised by Matthew Perich. My research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and neuroscience. I am intrigued by the brain’s remarkable ability to integrate information from different regions to produce complex behaviours and adapt to novel environments. Currently, I am working on understanding the underlying compositional structure of flexible behaviour in the brain."

  bio: "Hello, I am Julia! I am doing a PhD in Paul De Koninck and Flavie Lavoie-Cardinal Labs, mostly working on actin cytoskeleton using super-resolution microscopy. From a complete neuroscience background, I now collaborate with students in machine learning that developed innovative methods to analyze images. Beyond science, I really enjoy helping to organize events. I actively engage with associations to organize student-friendly events, fostering both community building and professional development opportunities. I'm looking forward to the USS 2024 conference and the enriching experiences it promises to offer!"

  bio: "I'm a PhD student co-supervised by Christian Gagné and Flavie Lavoie-Cardinal, both members of UNIQUE. After a bachelor's degree in engineering physics, I'm pursuing my studies in the field of machine learning to extend my knowledge to new methods applied to subjects I was already passionate about, such as photonics and life science. My project focuses specifically on the application of deep neural networks for enhancing and assisting the acquisition of Fluorescence Nanoscopy images."
