  bio: "I am a postdoctoral researcher at Courtois NeuroMod project (CRIUGM) and working with with Prof. Pierre Bellec in implementing encoding models to predict brain activities of processing the natural language using representations extracted from natural language models. My main interest lies in developing approaches to improve the predictive performance of the neural networks of language models with well-defined features from the cross-model brain representations of naturalistic information processing."
