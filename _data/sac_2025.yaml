  bio: "I am a PhD student working with Vincent Taschereau-Dumouchel on bridging the gap between quantitative and qualitative approaches in cognitive neuroscience and computational psychiatry. During my master's, I worked on mapping out subjective experience using a combination of psychometrics, NLP and generative AI, with a focus on accelerating mental health care research. I now aim to develop innovative applications of AI to the study of brains and consciousness. Being part of the UNIQUE SAC, as well as the broader neuroAI community, has been a huge source of inspiration and motivation, which is why I'm eager to continue on this path for a second year."

  bio: "I am a PhD student in Psychology at Université de Montréal under the guidance of Prof. Shahab Bakhtiari. My research is at intersection of artificial intelligence and neuroscience, particularly focusing on modelling the visual system. I use artificial neural networks trained with self-supervised learning to simulate and understand the complexities of the visual system."

  bio: "I am a master's student at Mila and Université de Montréal with Matthew Perich and Guillaume Lajoie. I am intrigued by how AI systems can rapidly learn and generalize to new tasks given little to no information. To this end, I aim to mathematically elucidate how different paradigms of task learning (e.g., continual, meta, in-context, etc.) are affected by factors such as learning dynamics, compositional representations, and memory."

  bio: "I am a Neuroscience PhD student at McGill University's Integrated Program, collaborating with Prof. Sylvain Baillet and Prof. John Kalaska in advancing knowledge of non-motor functions of the motor cortex, an area of the brain classically known for its role in executive functions such as decision making. I have a strong interest in devising and implementing sophisticated techniques to measure complex patterns in ongoing human brain activity. I am very excited to be part of the UNIQUE community and looking forward to collaborating with other members of this community to improve our understanding of the brain and develop new tools to address important questions in neuroscience."

  bio: "I am a graduate student at Mila and Université de Montréal supervised by Matthew Perich. My research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and neuroscience. I am intrigued by the brain’s remarkable ability to integrate information from different regions to produce complex behaviours and adapt to novel environments. Currently, I am working on understanding the underlying compositional structure of flexible behaviour in the brain."
